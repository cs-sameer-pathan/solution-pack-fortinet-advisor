## Generating Playbooks

Generating playbooks with the OpenAI assistant allows you to streamline and automate threat mitigation processes efficiently. The following section provides detailed instructions on how to create and manage playbooks using the assistant's capabilities.

>[!TIP]
>It is recommended to create smaller playbook blocks for easier review and minimal changes in the JSON template generated by FortiAI. You can then combine these small playbook blocks to create a larger playbook for your desired workflow.

### Use Case Example: Mitigating Threats

One common use case involves creating a playbook to extract indicators from an alert and enrich them using a threat intelligence tool such as VirusTotal. Based on the reputation data received from VirusTotal, the playbook updates the indicator's reputation as follows:

- **Malicious**: If the reputation returned by VirusTotal is *Malicious*.
- **Suspicious**: If the reputation returned by VirusTotal is *Suspicious*.
- **Good**: If the reputation returned by VirusTotal is anything but *Suspicious*.

### Creating a Playbook Using Playbook Designer

1. **Initiate Playbook Designer**: To learn more about working with Playbook Designer, refer to the section [Creating Playbooks](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortisoar/7.6.0/playbooks-guide/331279/introduction-to-playbooks#Creating_Playbooks) in the Playbooks Guide of FortiSOAR product documentation.

   - From the **Playbook Designer**, type your requirements in a conversational format. For example:

    >*Extract Indicators from the Alert Source Data and enrich them using VirusTotal. Based upon reputation, if `malicious` update the indicator reputation to `malicious` else if `suspicious` update the indicator reputation to `suspicious` else update indicator reputation to good.*

2. **Modify Playbook Outline**:
   - Adjust the playbook outline as needed, such as changing the integration tool from VirusTotal to IPStack. You can edit the JSON file and write *IPStack* instead of *VirusTotal*. The bot can also handle if there are typos in specifying the connector name.     

    ![FortiAI - Suggested playbook outline](../docs/res/FortiAIPBGeneration.png)

3. **Generate Playbook**:
   - Once satisfied with the outline, click **Ok, Generate Playbook**.

>[!NOTE]
>If a step uses a connector that is not installed, FortiAI informs you with a message indicating that the specific step requires a connector that is not installed on the system.

4. **Monitor Playbook Generation**:
   - A loader image indicates the progress while FortiAI is generating playbook steps.
   
5. **Review Generated Playbook**:
   - After the steps have been generated, a suggested playbook block appears in the *Playbook Designer*. You can review each step by double-clicking it and examining the details.

    ![Reviewing a playbook step generated by FortiAI](../docs/res/FortiAIGeneratedPb_StepReview.png)

6. **Integrate and Finalize Playbook**:
   - Connect the reviewed AI-generated playbook blocks to the main playbook flow to create a complete workflow.

The ability to generate playbooks through OpenAI's assistant represents a significant advancement in playbook design, offering immense assistance to those new to developing playbooks. By following the above steps, administrators can efficiently create and manage robust playbooks to address various threat mitigation scenarios.

[!TIP]
>It is recommended that you clear a conversation before executing different use cases. Clearing conversations also helps in saving tokens being consumed.

## Navigating Page

Navigating pages within the FortiAI assistant allows users to access various modules and records efficiently. This functionality enhances workflow efficiency and helps users locate and manage the required information across the system.

### Use Case Example: Accessing Records

One common use case involves accessing specific records quickly. For instance, a security analyst needs to review the details of a particular alert or incident. By issuing navigation commands, the analyst can access the required records without unnecessary delays.

### Navigating a Page Using FortiAI Assistant
